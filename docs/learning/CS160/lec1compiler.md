# Compiler  

- A compiler is a program that translates from one programming language to another  
- High-level source code to low-level machine code

## Source Code

**Optimized for human readability**  

- Expressive: matches human ideas of grammar / syntax / meaning
- Redundant: more information than needed to help catch errors
- Abstract: data structures, design patterns, etc.  

## Machine Code

**Optimized for Hardware**  

- Machine code hard for people to read
- Reduce redundancy & ambiguity
- Abstractions & information about intent is lost
- Assembly language — then machine language  

## How to translate  

Goals of translation:

- Source level expressiveness for the task
- Best performance for the concrete computation
- Reasonable translation efficiency
- Maintainable code – Correctness!
