# Chapter 1 Introduction to Model Checking   

## 摘要

>A computer-assisted method for the analysis of dynamical systems that can be modeled by state-transition systems.
>
>Drawing from research traditions in mathematical logic, programming languages, hardware design, and theoretical computer science, model checking is now widely used for the verification of hardware and software in industry.



## 计算机辅助验证之例

>The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness.  

- The main challenge is scalability: real-world software systems not only include complex control and data structures, but depend on much “context” such as libraries and interfaces to other code, including lower-level systems code.   

- This asymmetry between coding and verification is the main motivation for computer-aided verification.
