I am a graduate student working on software engineering at the [Inplus Lab](https://inpluslab.com/) of Sun Yat-sen University. My research interests include *software engineering and smart contracts*. Now, I am  supervised by Associate Prof. [Yuhong Nan](https://nanyuhong.github.io/) and Prof. [Zibin Zheng](http://www.zibinzheng.com), co-working with many awesome lab fellows. Meanwhile, based on soft programs of our lab, I have been drawing much effort on the digital economy and data assets. 

### Research Publication
> I am now focusing on different dependable aspects of smart contracts. Besides basic program analysis, I am trying to solve problems between human intention and code.
