I am a graduate student working on software engineering at the Inplus Lab of Sun Yat-sen University. My research interests include software security, program analysis and smart contracts. Now, I am  supervised by Associate Prof. [Yuhong Nan](https://nanyuhong.github.io/) and Prof. [Zibin Zheng](http://www.zibinzheng.com), co-working with many awesome lab fellows. Meanwhile, I have been drawing much effort on the digital economy at the top-level planning due to programs of our lab.
